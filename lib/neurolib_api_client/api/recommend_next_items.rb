  ##
  #Returns items that shall be shown to a user as next recommendations when the user e.g. scrolls the page down (*infinite scroll*) or goes to a next page.
  #
  #It accepts `recommId` of a base recommendation request (e.g. request from the first page) and number of items that shall be returned (`count`).
  #The base request can be one of:
  #  - [Recommend items to item](https://www.neurolib.io/pages/documentation/api.html#recommend-items-to-item)
  #  - [Recommend items to user](https://www.neurolib.io/pages/documentation/api.html#recommend-items-to-user)
  #  - [Search items](https://www.neurolib.io/pages/documentation/api.html#search-items)
  #
  #All the other parameters are inherited from the base request.
  #
  #*Recommend next items* can be called many times for a single `recommId` and each call returns different (previously not recommended) items.
  #The number of *Recommend next items* calls performed so far is returned in the `numberNextRecommsCalls` field.
  #
  #*Recommend next items* can be requested up to 30 minutes after the base request or a previous *Recommend next items* call.
  #
  #For billing purposes, each call to *Recommend next items* is counted as a separate recommendation request.
