  ##
  #Recommends set of items that are somehow related to one given item, *X*. Typical scenario  is when user *A* is viewing *X*. Then you may display items to the user that he might be also interested in. Recommend items to item request gives you Top-N such items, optionally taking the target user *A* into account.
  #
  #The returned items are sorted by relevance (first item being the most relevant).
  #
  #Besides the recommended items, also a unique `recommId` is returned in the response. It can be used to:
  #
  #- Let Neurolib know that this recommendation was successful (e.g. user clicked one of the recommended items). See [Reported metrics](https://www.neurolib.io/pages/documentation/admin_ui.html#reported-metrics).
  #- Get subsequent recommended items when the user scrolls down (*infinite scroll*) or goes to the next page. See [Recommend Next Items](https://www.neurolib.io/pages/documentation/api.html#recommend-next-items).
  #
  #It is also possible to use POST HTTP method (for example in case of very long ReQL filter) - query parameters then become body parameters.

  ##
  # * *Required arguments*
  #   - +item_id+ -> ID of the item for which the recommendations are to be generated.
  #   - +target_user_id+ -> ID of the user who will see the recommendations.
  #
  #Specifying the *targetUserId* is beneficial because:
  #
  #* It makes the recommendations personalized
  #* Allows the calculation of Actions and Conversions
  #  in the graphical user interface,
  #  as Neurolib can pair the user who got recommendations
  #  and who afterwards viewed/purchased an item.
  #
  #If you insist on not specifying the user, pass `null`
  #(`None`, `nil`, `NULL` etc. depending on language) to *targetUserId*.
  #Do not create some special dummy user for getting recommendations,
  #as it could mislead the recommendation models,
  #and result in wrong recommendations.
  #
  #For anonymous/unregistered users it is possible to use for example their session ID.
  #
  #   - +count+ -> Number of items to be recommended (N for the top-N recommendation).
  #
  # * *Optional arguments (given as hash optional)*
  #   - +scenario+ -> Scenario defines a particular application of recommendations. It can be for example "homepage", "cart" or "emailing".
  #
  #You can set various settings to the [scenario](https://www.neurolib.io/pages/documentation/scenarios.html) in the [Admin UI](https://admin.neurolib.io). You can also see performance of each scenario in the Admin UI separately, so you can check how well each application performs.
  #
  #The AI which optimizes models in order to get the best results may optimize different scenarios separately, or even use different models in each of the scenarios.
  #
  #   - +cascadeCreate+ -> If item of given *itemId* or user of given *targetUserId* doesn't exist in the database, it creates the missing entity/entities and returns some (non-personalized) recommendations. This allows for example rotations in the following recommendations for the user of given *targetUserId*, as the user will be already known to the system.
  #   - +returnProperties+ -> With `returnProperties=true`, property values of the recommended items are returned along with their IDs in a JSON dictionary. The acquired property values can be used for easy displaying of the recommended items to the user.
  #
  #Example response:
  #```

  #        }
  #      ],
  #    "numberNextRecommsCalls": 0

  #
  #   - +includedProperties+ -> Allows to specify, which properties should be returned when `returnProperties=true` is set. The properties are given as a comma-separated list.
  #
  #Example response for `includedProperties=description,price`:
  #```
  #  {
  #    "recommId": "6842c725-a79f-4537-a02c-f34d668a3f80",

  #  }
  #```
  #
  #   - +filter+ -> Boolean-returning [ReQL](https://www.neurolib.io/pages/documentation) expression which allows you to filter recommended items based on the values of their attributes.
  #
  #Filters can be also assigned to a [scenario](https://www.neurolib.io/pages/documentation/scenarios.html) in the [Admin UI](https://admin.neurolib.io).
  #
  #   - +booster+ -> Number-returning [ReQL](https://www.neurolib.io/pages/documentation) expression which allows you to boost recommendation rate of some items based on the values of their attributes.
  #
  #Boosters can be also assigned to a [scenario](https://www.neurolib.io/pages/documentation/scenarios.html) in the [Admin UI](https://admin.neurolib.io).
  #
  #   - +logic+ -> Logic specifies particular behavior of the recommendation models. You can pick tailored logic for your domain and use case.
  #See [this section](https://www.neurolib.io/pages/documentation/recommendation_logics.html) for list of available logics and other details.
  #
  #The difference between `logic` and `scenario` is that `logic` specifies mainly behavior, while `scenario` specifies the place where recommendations are shown to the users.
  #
  #Logic can be also set to a [scenario](https://www.neurolib.io/pages/documentation/scenarios.html) in the [Admin UI](https://admin.neurolib.io).
  #
  #   - +userImpact+ -> **Expert option** If *targetUserId* parameter is present, the recommendations are biased towards the given user. Using *userImpact*, you may control this bias. For an extreme case of `userImpact=0.0`, the interactions made by the user are not taken into account at all (with the exception of history-based blacklisting), for `userImpact=1.0`, you'll get user-based recommendation. The default value is `0`.
  #
  #   - +diversity+ -> **Expert option** Real number from [0.0, 1.0] which determines how much mutually dissimilar should the recommended items be. The default value is 0.0, i.e., no diversification. Value 1.0 means maximal diversification.
  #
  #   - +minRelevance+ -> **Expert option** If the *targetUserId* is provided:  Specifies the threshold of how much relevant must the recommended items be to the user. Possible values one of: "low", "medium", "high". The default value is "low", meaning that the system attempts to recommend number of items equal to *count* at any cost. If there are not enough data (such as interactions or item properties), this may even lead to bestseller-based recommendations to be appended to reach the full *count*. This behavior may be suppressed by using "medium" or "high" values. In such case, the system only recommends items of at least the requested relevance, and may return less than *count* items when there is not enough data to fulfill it.
  #
  #   - +rotationRate+ -> **Expert option** If the *targetUserId* is provided: If your users browse the system in real-time, it may easily happen that you wish to offer them recommendations multiple times. Here comes the question: how much should the recommendations change? Should they remain the same, or should they rotate? Neurolib API allows you to control this per-request in backward fashion. You may penalize an item for being recommended in the near past. For the specific user, `rotationRate=1` means maximal rotation, `rotationRate=0` means absolutely no rotation. You may also use, for example `rotationRate=0.2` for only slight rotation of recommended items.
  #
  #   - +rotationTime+ -> **Expert option** If the *targetUserId* is provided: Taking *rotationRate* into account, specifies how long time it takes to an item to recover from the penalization. For example, `rotationTime=7200.0` means that items recommended less than 2 hours ago are penalized.
  #
  #   - +expertSettings+ -> Dictionary of custom options.
  #
  #   - +returnAbGroup+ -> If there is a custom AB-testing running, return name of group to which the request belongs.
  #
